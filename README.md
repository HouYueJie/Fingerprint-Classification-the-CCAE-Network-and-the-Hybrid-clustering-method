# Fingerprint-Classification-the-CCAE-Network-and-the-Hybrid-clustering-method
This project is the direction of fingerprint classification in biological field. Firstly, The CCAE is used to extract and encode fingerprint data. Finally, the hybrid clustering is used for ensemble clustering. The clustering result can reach 97.4% accuracy  in the unsupervised field.
